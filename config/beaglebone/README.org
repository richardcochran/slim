* Introduction

  The 'beaglebone' board supports the popular Beagle Bone Black, a
  development board for the TI AM3358 ARM Cortex-A8.  The SLIM board
  support was originally developed using Linaro gcc 4.8 2014.04, but
  any recent ARM toolchain should work.

* Compiling the Image

  - export BOARD=beaglebone
  - make
  - make install

* Booting the Image

  This section describes how to use the RAM disk file system. We
  assume that you have also selected CONFIG_linux and have compiled a
  Linux kernel as part of the SLIM build. First we show how to try out
  the image without installing anything. Then we show you can boot the
  RAM disk automatically by copying the images to the FAT file system
  on the microSD card.

** Manual Boot Procedure

   This procedure uses the RAM disk root file system, fetching the
   kernel and rootfs via TFTP.

*** Configure the U-Boot network settings

    1. Check network settings with the 'printenv' command.
    2. Change 'serverip' if needed.

       setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.77
       setenv serverip 192.168.1.12
       setenv netmask 255.255.255.0

*** Load and boot the image via TFTP

    setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 mem=512M root=/dev/ram rw
	 initrd=0x81000000,16MB ramdisk_size=16384 earlyprintk=serial

    tftp 80200000 beaglebone-zImage
    tftp 81000000 beaglebone-initrd.gz
    tftp 80F80000 am335x-boneblack.dtb
    bootz 80200000 - 80F80000

** Automatic Boot Procedure

   If you want to have the SLIM image boot automatically after
   powering on the device, then you can copy the images to a microSD
   card. For the beagle bone white, you can use the card that came
   with it. The beagle bone black does not come with a microSD card,
   but it is easy to make one work with it. Simply copy the files,
   u-boot.img and MLO, from the boot partition to a FAT file system on
   a fresh microSD card. You can access the boot partition by booting
   the original firmware and then mounting the USB mass storage device
   on your PC computer.

*** Beagle Bone Black

    Copy the following files onto the FAT partition on the microSD
    card.

    - am335x-boneblack.dtb
    - beaglebone-initrd.gz
    - beaglebone-zImage

    On the FAT partition, edit the file, uEnv.txt, so that it reads as
    follows. Be careful to preserve the very long lines.

bootargs=console=ttyS0,115200n8 mem=512M root=/dev/ram rw initrd=0x81000000,16MB ramdisk_size=16384 earlyprintk=serial
